Install Guide for the glite-data-hydra-service component.

0. Prerequisites
   =============
   
   We assume tomcat5 and MySQL are installed at the usual locations,
   CA certificates, VOMS server certificates are at the proper locations
   and Tomcat is configured to use them via the trustmanager
   package.

1. Simple Configuration
   ====================

   Please copy the 
    $GLITE_LOCATION/etc/glite-data-hydra-service/config.properties.example
   to
    $GLITE_LOCATION/etc/glite-data-hydra-service/config.properties
   and edit the properties (for example DB username and password).

   Using the default values from this file, you only have to run the 
   	$GLITE_LOCATION/sbin/glite-data-hydra-service-configure.sh
   program and restart tomcat5, using "service tomcat5 restart".

   For example, if $GLITE_LOCATION is "/opt/glite", then the command is

     /opt/glite/sbin/glite-data-hydra-service-configure.sh

   If the current user cannot became a database administrator without
   typing a password, then please use the --withpass option:

     /opt/glite/sbin/glite-data-hydra-service-configure.sh --withpass

   You can test the service by looking at the following URL:
    
     https://localhost:8443/default/glite-data-hydra-service

   and use it, trying a test method:

     https://localhost:8443/default/glite-data-hydra-service/services/Hydra?method=getVersion

2. Multi-VO Configuration
   ======================

   Running the configurator without parameters sets up a service for the 'default'
   virtual organization. If you need to set up multiple VOs or a non-default VO 
   name, then you need to pass an extra parameter to the configure script:
     
      glite-data-hydra-service-configure.sh --vo egee

   There will be another service instance configured for this VO, at the location
    
      https://localhost:8443/egee/glite-data-hydra-service

   IMPORTANT: you have to edit the 'config.properties' file and add separate 
   DBNAME for each VO:
       
       glite-data-hydra-service.default.DBNAME = hydra_default
       glite-data-hydra-service.egee.DBNAME    = hydra

   You may also override with VO specific values the other variables, however it 
   is not necessary.


3. Unconfigure
   ===========

   Run the VO specific unconfigure script:
    
     $GLITE_LOCATION/etc/glite-data-hydra-service/glite-data-hydra-service-<VO_name>.unconfigure

   IMPORTANT: the unconfigure script will remove the database without any question!
   Please edit the file or back up your database, if it has to be preserved!

4. Explained
   =========

   The service needs a context.xml file for Tomcat. This is 
   generated into the 'etc' directory and then copied to the tomcat
   configuration directory: /etc/tomcat5/Catalina/localhost.

   For the database connection the JDBC driver has to be copied into 
   Tomcat's 'common/lib' directory. The jar files are not part of the
   RPM (due to license restrictions), so the configuration script 
   cannot copy them to the appropriate place, but it prints out the 
   exact commands on how to do this by hand.

   One can run the script only to instantiate the templates and print
   the commands using the '--dryrun' option. This way one can do the
   steps one-by-one to debug possible errors.
